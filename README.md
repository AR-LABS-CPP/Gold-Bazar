# Gold-Bazar
Gold bazar is a GUI application made using java swing for businesses that buy and sell gold. It helps in keeping track of transactions and the daily rate of gold. It also helps in the management of gold inventory. Gold bazar also has reporting and printing functionalities. 

This was the project that I made during my internship as a Java developer. The biggest accomplishment for me in this project was that I created a unified class for handling all database interactions using JDBC. This resolved the issues of code repetition and the need to constantly remember different options related to JDBC.
